# Project Chinook-Music Backend

A backend API project written in Go to serve the [Chinook Database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database), which represents a digital music store. A frontend will also be created to consume the API endpoints created in this project. 

The main goal of this project is to allow me to practice writing an app using Go.
